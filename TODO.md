# TODO: Add Social Media Share Buttons to SuccessMessage

## Tasks
- [x] Update SuccessMessage.tsx to add share buttons for LinkedIn, Twitter, and WhatsApp
- [x] Implement share functions that generate appropriate URLs with content: "I attended this event, thank you for your participation, and here's my lifelong experience."
- [x] Add icons for the buttons using lucide-react
- [x] Test the share functionality by running the app and checking if buttons open correct URLs

## Notes
- Certificate is generated client-side as PNG data URL
- For sharing, use text content and mention certificate download
- Buttons placed after the existing buttons in SuccessMessage
- App is running on http://localhost:8084, server on port 5000 (already in use, assuming it's running)
